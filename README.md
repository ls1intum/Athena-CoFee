# Athene: A library to support (semi-)automated assessment of textual exercises

This library implements an approach for (semi-)automated assessment of textual exercises and can be integrated in learning management systems (LMS). A reference integration exists for the LMS [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis).

The approach is based on the paper:
> Jan Philip Bernius and Bernd Bruegge. 2019. **Toward the Automatic Assessment of Text Exercises**. In *2nd Workshop on Innovative Software Engineering Education (ISEE)*. Stuttgart, Germany, 19â€“22. [[pdf]](https://brn.is/isee19)

## Components

- **Clustering:**  
  API for computing Language Embeddings using ELMo and Clustering of ELMo Vectors using HDBSCAN
- **Segmentation:**  
  API for segmenting Student Answers based on Topic Modeling

## Contributing
