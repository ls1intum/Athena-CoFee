# Athene: A library to support (semi-)automated assessment of textual exercises

This library implements an approach for (semi-)automated assessment of textual exercises and can be integrated in learning management systems (LMS). A reference integration exists for the LMS [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis).

The approach is based on the paper:
> Jan Philip Bernius and Bernd Bruegge. 2019. **Toward the Automatic Assessment of Text Exercises**. In *2nd Workshop on Innovative Software Engineering Education (ISEE)*. Stuttgart, Germany, 19â€“22. [[pdf]](https://brn.is/isee19)

## Components

-   **Load-balancer:** Provides API to submit an Athene job. This component will manage the work distribution to other components
-   **Segmentation:** API for segmenting Student Answers based on Topic Modeling
-   **Embedding:** API for computing Language Embeddings using ELMo and uploading training material for ELMo
-   **Clustering:** API for clustering of ELMo Vectors using HDBSCAN

## Basic Usage

Using the `docker-compose.yml` file included in the root directory of the repository is the easiest way to start Athene. The execution of

```
docker-compose up -d
```

will automatically build and start the Load-balancer, Segmentation, the Embedding and the Clustering component (The `-d` parameter will run containers in the background). By default, a traefik-container will manage API-Endpoints and expose them on port 80 (default HTTP-port). This means, the following API-routes will be available after start:  

-   [http://localhost/submit](http://localhost/submit) - For Artemis to submit a job to the load-balancer
-   [http://localhost/queueStatus](http://localhost/queueStatus) - To monitor the queue Status of the load balancer
-   [http://localhost/getTask](http://localhost/getTask) - For the computation components to query tasks from the load balancer
-   [http://localhost/sendTaskResult](http://localhost/sendTaskResult) - For the computation components to send back results to the load balancer
-   [http://localhost/upload](http://localhost/upload) - For Artemis to upload course material
-   [http://localhost/tracking](http://localhost/tracking) - For Artemis to access tracking functionality
-   [http://localhost/feedback_consistency](http://localhost/feedback_consistency) - For Artemis to access feedback_consistency functionality

In addition to that, traefik provides a dashboard to monitor the status of underlying components. This dashboard will be available on [http://localhost:8081/dashboard](http://localhost:8080/dashboard) by default.

For testing and development purposes, a single component can be re-built using e.g.

```
docker-compose build segmentation
```

or be started separately (in foreground mdoe) using e.g.

```
docker-compose up segmentation
```

Stopping Athene can be achieved by stopping the running containers using

```
docker-compose down
```

For further information have a look at the [Compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) and the [Compose command-line reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/).

## Configuration

For configuration of the Athene-system you can make use of the `.env`-file in the repository. All variables in there are used in the `docker-compose.yml` to bring up the Athene system.
