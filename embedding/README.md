# Embedding Service

## Start locally (without Docker)
Locally, the service runs on port 8002. To start it, 

- first, run the following command for some preparations:
   ```bash
   ./local-prepare.sh
    ```
- After that, configure the used virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  If you use an IDE, you can also configure the virtual environment there.
  In PyCharm, you can even go to `File > Open`, choose the embedding folder
  and then choose the `Attach` option.
- Then, you can start the embedding server using `python start.py` or using your IDE.


## Start with Docker
Use the `docker-compose.yml` file from the parent directory
to start the embedding service (and all others) with Docker.


## Options
Configurable environment variables:

- `BALANCER_QUEUE_FREQUENCY`
- `BALANCER_GETTASK_URL`
- `CHUNK_SIZE`
- `BALANCER_SENDRESULT_URL`

## API
